        <p>
          One of the most notable IIC BattleMechs, the
          <mark> Marauder IIC </mark> is based upon one of the most iconic
          'Mechs in existence, the Marauder.
        </p>
        <p>
          Touted as one of the most effective 'Mechs of all time, the Marauder
          saw wide usage during the Star League era by all the Great Houses. The
          design was also much favored by both the Star League Defense Force's
          Regular and Royal units as well as its famed Gunslingers, with many
          examples taken on Operation EXODUS. The belief that the Marauder was a
          precursor to a new 'Mech design paradigm disappeared in the Inner
          Sphere as the Succession Wars dragged on; however, in the same year as
          the Second Succession War broke out the Clans developed a followup to
          the venerable design, later dubbed the Marauder IIC, representing the
          pinnacle of Clan weapons technology prior to the advent of the
          OmniMech.[7] Like other IIC designs, visual similarities between it
          and its predecessor initially led ComStar to incorrectly label the
          design as a mere refit of the original.[8]
        </p>
        <p>
          It is to the credit of its original engineers that no new production
          variants of the Marauder IIC appeared until a wellspring of new
          technology emerged in the 3050s and '60s, with Clan Star Adder
          introducing a visually refreshed model carrying the then-newly
          developed Heavy Lasers that quickly spread to the Cloud Cobras,
          Goliath Scorpions, Snow Ravens, Blood Spirits and Diamond Sharks.[9]
          The efforts of the mercantile Sharks would result in the further
          spread of the design to the Inner Sphere-based Invading Clans,
          followed by Clans Jade Falcon and Ghost Bear introducing new Marauder
          IIC variants and constructing new production lines for them on Sudeten
          and Satalice respectively during the Word of Blake Jihad.[2]

        <h2 id="p-2">Weapons and Equipment</h2>
        <p>
          As with the <mark> Warhammer IIC </mark>, the
          <mark>Marauder IIC</mark> is ten-tons heavier than its Inner Sphere
          progenitor, pushing it into the assault weight class, but otherwise
          the design matches the original's ground speed through the use of a
          340-rated standard fusion engine. Though both designs carry eleven and
          half tons of armor, the Marauder IIC's use of more advanced
          ferro-fibrous plating gives it superior protection, with an endo steel
          frame freeing up weight. While structurally the Marauder IIC appears
          to offer little advantage over the LosTech refitted Marauders
          introduced by the Successor States, the blatant superiority of Clan
          weaponry allows the design to pound its opponents to pieces in short
          order.[10]
        </p>
        <p>
          Built around the Extended-Range Particle Projector Cannon, one of the
          most powerful weapons in the Clan arsenal, the Marauder IIC's weapon
          layout is typical of the standard Marauder, each pod-like forearm
          carrying an ER PPC paired with Medium Pulse Lasers. Where the Marauder
          IIC differs is with its torso weaponry, replacing the top-mounted
          autocannon and its vulnerable ammunition-feed linkage with another ER
          PPC, and adding a set of four ER Small Lasers. Twenty-one double heat
          sinks keep heat levels manageable, with an enterprising MechWarrior
          able to use volley fire to keep up a steady barrage of fire.[10]

        <h3 id="p-3">Variants</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>Marauder IIC 2</h4>
            <p>
              In order to humiliate Clan Blood Spirit, Clan Star Adder upgraded
              their second-line forces and used them to retaliate against that
              Clan's interference in their Absorption of Clan Burrock. Part of
              this upgrade was the Marauder IIC 2. Adder scientists retained the
              Medium Pulse Lasers, but exchanged the PPCs and small lasers for
              two Series 4D-2 Heavy Large Lasers and a dorsal mounted Series XIV
              ER Large Laser. The result is a hard-hitting design that is most
              effective at close range. In order to help the 'Mech get to close
              range, it includes four Guld Mk. III jump jets that are capable of
              vaulting the 'Mech up to 120 meters in a single bound. Three extra
              heat sinks enable the firing of all the close-range weapons. The
              weight left over was used in the form of an additional ton of
              armor, bringing it to twelve-and-a-half tons, equivalent to
              fifteen tons of standard armor.[1] BV (1.0) = 2,244;[11] BV (2.0)
              = 2,244[1] or 2,358[12]
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Marauder IIC 3</h4>
            <p>
              The IIC 3 is another variant created by Clan Star Adder, but they
              did not hoard this one all for themselves. Similar to the original
              with an ER PPC in each arm and two ER Small Lasers in the center
              torso, it also includes a left-torso-mounted ATM 12. Three tons of
              ammunition allow flexibility in ammo selection and an additional
              double heat sink makes it perfectly heat-efficient.[1][13] BV
              (1.0) = 2,271;[13] BV (2.0) = 2,445[14]
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Marauder IIC 4</h4>
            <p>
              Developed by Gorton, Kingsley & Thorpe Enterprises in 3070 to fill
              the Ghost Bear touman's appetite for the Marauder IIC after a
              shadow trade war with the Diamond Sharks cut off supply, this
              variant mounts two of the largest weapon now available to the
              Clans, the HAG 40, in its arms. Ten tons of ammunition supply
              these mammoth guns, while fifteen tons of armor protect the 'Mech.
              The inclusion of the HAGs only allowed for three jump jets to be
              added, meaning that the IIC 4 can leap up to 90 meters. Even with
              only 10 double heat sinks, the IIC 4 has no heat concerns.[15][2]
              BV (2.0) = 3,447[16]
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Marauder IIC 5</h4>
            <p>
              Manufactured by the Jade Falcons from 3077 onward on a
              Sudeten-based production line adjacent to that of the Turkina, the
              IIC 5 is similar to the original, its arms carrying paired Type
              DDS "Kingston" ER PPCs for anti-'Mech duty but with underslung
              Tau-II AP Gauss Rifles to keep infantry at bay. Reminiscent of
              Star League Marauders GM Whirlwind, a HAG 20 sits in the dorsal
              assembly along with two tons of ammunition. The IIC 5 maintains
              the 11.5 tons of ferro fibrous armor used for the original, though
              some is shifted from the arms and side torsos to the legs and
              center torso. Nineteen double heat sinks keep the 'Mech's heat
              levels totally under control.[15][2] BV (2.0) = 2,386[17]
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Marauder IIC 6</h4>
            <p>
              Another Jade Falcon built variation first appearing in 3081, the
              arms of this version feature a Gauss rifle in its right and an LB
              10-X AC in its left, supported by a pair of ER Medium Lasers and a
              dorsal-mounted Heavy Large Laser. Its loadout made possible by an
              XL engine, the Marauder IIC 6 also mounts six Improved Jump Jets,
              which provide an interesting surprise for the largely Clan Wolf
              forces that face it. Thirteen tons of standard armor provide
              protection.[2] BV (2.0) = 2,646[18]
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Marauder IIC 7</h4>
            <p>
              Developed following the poor staying power of the Marauder IIC 4
              and inspired by the Viking, this Gorton, Kingsley, and
              Thorpe-produced variant of the Marauder IIC was introduced in 3081
              and uses a Targeting Computer to guide a Type 0 HAG 30, Omega
              12-Coil Gauss Rifle, Kolibri Delta Series Large Pulse and Series
              1g ER Small Laser. A Smartshot Mark V Streak SRM-4 mounted in each
              arm keeps battle armor at bay. An ECM Suite jams enemy targeting
              systems. To make room for all the weaponry a smaller 255-rated XL
              engine is used, dropping the top speed of the 'Mech to about 55
              km/h. Sixteen and a half tons of standard armor provide the
              maximum amount of protection that the chassis can carry. BV (2.0)
              = 2,843[2]
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Marauder IIC 8</h4>
            <p>
              Introduced back in 3025 but unknown to Inner Sphere intelligence
              forces until the Jihad era, this older version replaces the ER PPC
              found in the left arm with the Medium Pulse Laser from the right
              arm. An LRM-10 with a ton of ammunition is added to the left torso
              and the ER Small Lasers in the center and right torsos are
              replaced with a single Medium Pulse Laser in each. BV (2.0) =
              2,554[19][20]
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Marauder IIC 9</h4>
            <p>
              This variant uses the ER PPCs of the standard Marauder IIC but
              replaces the short range weapons with two Streak SRM-4s, one in
              the center torso and one in the right torso. These missile
              launchers share a single ton of ammunition. BV (2.0) = 2,595[21]
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Marauder IIC 10</h4>
            <p>
              This variant uses six Improved Jump Jets to cover 180 meters at a
              time. The weapons have changed: Each arm carries a Large Pulse
              Laser over a Medium Pulse Laser. There is an ER PPC in the left
              torso, and a pair of ER Small Lasers in the center torso. A Small
              Pulse Laser is mounted in each side torso for anti-infantry work.
              Twenty double heat sinks are fitted, and the 'Mech is protected by
              thirteen tons of armor. BV (2.0) = 2,877[22]
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Apocryphal Variants</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <h4>MAD-IIC-A</h4>
                <p>
                  A modern Clan take on the classic Succession Wars era MAR-3R
                  Marauder, the A variant retains the arm-mounted weaponry of
                  the standard Marauder IIC, removing the torso-mounted ER PPC
                  and ER Small Lasers in exchange for an LB 5-X AC in its right
                  torso supplied with single ton of ammo.[23]
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>MAD-IIC-B</h4>
                <p>
                  In many respects mirroring the loadout of the MAD-5D Marauder,
                  the B variant utilizes an 340-rated XL engine to free up the
                  weight to carry a Streak SRM-2 launcher in the left-torso,
                  supported with three tons of reloads, while swapping the
                  torso-mounted ER PPC for a Large Pulse Laser, retaining the
                  arm-mounted ER PPC and Medium Pulse Laser pods unchanged. Much
                  like the MAD-5D, four jump jets enhance its mobility with the
                  remaining weight devoted to sixteen tons of standard armor and
                  twenty-four double heat sinks.[23]
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>MAD-IIC-C</h4>
                <p>
                  Somewhat of a refined Clan interpretation of the MAD-5M
                  Marauder, the C variant carries an 340-rated XL engine to free
                  up the weight to carry three Large Pulse Lasers - two in the
                  left arm, one in the right, supported by one arm-mounted
                  Medium Pulse Laser in each arm and right torso-mounted LB 10-X
                  Autocannon supplied with two tons of reloads. Mounting only
                  nineteen double heat sinks, a shell of thirteen tons
                  ferro-fibrous armor protect the MAD-IIC-C while four jump jets
                  give it improved agility on the battlefield.[23]
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>MAD-IIC-D</h4>
                <p>
                  Seemingly inspired by the Marauder IIC 7, the somewhat slower
                  D variant is built around a 255-rated XL engine, carrying
                  Gauss Rifle and Streak SRM-4 launcher in each arm, supported
                  by a head-mounted ER Small Laser and right torso-mounted Large
                  Pulse Laser. The maximum amount of standard armor its Endo
                  Steel frame can carry, a Targeting Computer and an ECM Suite
                  ensure the MAD-IIC-D has every opportunity to use every one of
                  its five tons of Gauss rounds and two of Streak reloads.[23]
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>MAD-IIC-S</h4>
                <p>
                  A customized variant of the Marauder IIC, the Scorch mounts a
                  Large Pulse Laser and Ultra AC/5 in each arm supported by four
                  Streak SRM-6 launchers split between each side torso. Twelve
                  tons of ferro-fibrous armor protect Scorch and the two-tons
                  each of Streak and Ultra Autocannon ammo and fifteen double
                  heat-sinks it carries.[23]
